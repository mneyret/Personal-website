Combining ecological and social-ecological data in detailed landscape modelling approaches allowed me to assess the impact of landscape-level land use on the overall benefits derived by people from ecosystems. One originality of my research is thus to address the gap between the ecological (i.e. process-based relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning) and social (quality of life; social trade-offs between stakeholders) components of social-ecological systems.</p><p dir="auto">I am currently a Marie Sklodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellow at the Alpine Ecology Laboratory (LECA) in Grenoble, France on the project EquitES: Towards high and Equitable Nature's Contributions to people in the face of global changes. I am also associated to the <a href="https://www.biodiversa.eu/2023/04/19/reconnect/" rel="nofollow">RECONNECT</a> Bioriversa+ projet "Reconciling fragmented and contested landscapes". Through these projects, I focus on how restoration of landscape connectivity can promote both biodiversity and equitable Nature's contributions to different social groups.</p><p dir="auto">My first postdoctoral stay was in the <a href="http://www.bik-f.de/root/index.php?page_id=1227" rel="nofollow">Causes and Consequences of Biodiversity Change group</a> of the Senckenberg BiK-F in Frankfurt, Germany, as part of the <a href="http://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/1/home/" rel="nofollow">Biodiversity Exploratories</a>, where I focused on community-level functional responses to land use intensity and landscape multifunctionality. Before that, I worked as a PhD candidate in Sorbonne Universités (Paris, France) and Institute of Research for Development, where I studied the interactions between non-cultivated plant communities, farming practices and soil characteristics in Northern Thailand.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://neyret.me/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://neyret.me/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=d0fc1030089a37f93a2d51bf6d07565c"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

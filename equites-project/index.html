These benefits, also known as ecosystem services or nature’s contributions to people (NCP), are fundamental to human well-being.<br><br>However, access to these contributions and the ability to benefit from them vary among individuals depending on their geographic location, personal preferences, and mobility. As a result, significant disparities may arise between social groups, particularly in terms of age, gender, and income.<br><br>Climate change further compounds these challenges, threatening the management and conservation of ecosystems and altering their capacity to provide benefits to society. For instance, the increasing frequency of droughts and heatwaves may lead to reduced food and fodder production in many European regions. Yet, how these changes affect nature’s contributions to different people — and how they are distributed among social groups — remains largely uncertain.<br><br>The EquitES project aims to better understand how climate change impacts nature’s contributions across different social groups.<br><br>More specifically, our objectives are to:</p><p>  • Identify the key socio-demographic factors driving disparities in access to, and benefits derived from, nature — and assess their impact on quality of life;<br>  <br>  • Evaluate how different climate change scenarios may influence these disparities;<br><br>  • Develop nature-based solutions that help mitigate these impacts while preserving biodiversity.<br><br>Our study area covers the broader Grenoble region in France.</p><h1><br>Project Activities and Results</h1><p>The project ran from October 2023 to November 2025.

However, strong disparities subsist in terms of climate risks, such as heatwave mitigation and protection from floods by the vegetation.</p><div class="page" title="Page 1"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Dans la région grenobloise, les populations urbaines vulnérables ont un accès raisonnable à des espaces verts de bonne qualité.

Urban green spaces provide many important benefits - from helping to reduce heat and flooding risks to offering places for recreation and relaxation. These  are essential for the well-being of city residents. However, these benefits are not shared equally across social groups. Environmental segregation, meaning the separation of population groups between areas with different environmental quality, is still common. Research in environmental justice has shown that low-income neighborhoods often have less and lower-quality green space. Yet, to support fairer urban planning, we need more detailed assessments that consider different types of ecosystem services and the diverse needs of communities.<br><br>In this study, we combined socio-demographic spatial data with NCP spatial modeling to examine inequalities in the distribution of three key services — heatwave mitigation, flood regulation, and urban recreation — in the Grenoble metropolitan area. For the urban recreation service, we created a novel recreation index that combines the quality and accessibility of urban green spaces.<br><br></p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/ROS.jpg" alt="" width="2481" height="1749" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/ROS-xs.jpg 640w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/ROS-sm.jpg 768w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/ROS-md.jpg 1024w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/ROS-lg.jpg 1366w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/ROS-xl.jpg 1600w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/ROS-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><br><figcaption>The newly developed urban recreation opportunity spectrum.

Many participants live in the Grenoble Metropolis, but around 53% lived in the rural or mountainous areas of the study region. </p><h3>Barriers to Nature's Contributions to People</h3><p class="msg--highlight msg--success msg">Key message: the barriers that limit access to nature and its contributions to quality of life are diverse. They include the low availability or quality of green and natural spaces, but also overcrowding, as well as lack of time or knowledge. Our survey show that people who live in rural areas, men, people with good physical mobility and high income report fewer barriers. Having less limitations was associated to a better quality of life and a recognition of nature's contributions to their well-being. </p><p>Nature's contributions to our quality of life - from production of resources to regulation of temperatures or recreational activities - are not shared equally across the population. Various barriers can limit access to them: physical barriers (poor quality of green spaces, limited access or transportation), legal barriers (private ownership), as well as social and individual barriers (feelings of insecurity, lack of time, social isolation). Understanding these barriers across social groups, as well as their effects on connection to nature (the sense of belonging to and closeness with the natural world around us) and on quality of life, is therefore a key lever for guiding actions aimed at ensuring equitable access to green and natural spaces. To address this issue, we conducted a survey between March and October 2024 among residents of the Isère department (France). </p><h5 data-start="1673" data-end="1705">Barriers to access to nature</h5><p data-start="1709" data-end="2348">The most frequently reported barriers depend on the type of contribution. Access to non-material contributions (cultural value, recreation) is mainly limited by lack of time and overcrowding of natural areas. Constraints related to material contributions (access to timber and local agricultural products) primarily involve a lack of productive spaces and time to access the products. Finally, contributions related to risk regulation—such as temperature regulation, flood mitigation, or water quality—are largely constrained by the availability and quality of green and natural spaces, as well as by a lack of knowledge about where these functions are provided.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/Barrieres_en.jpg" alt="Frequency of barriers reported by category of nature's contribution to people" width="1239" height="842" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/Barrieres_en-xs.jpg 640w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/Barrieres_en-sm.jpg 768w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/Barrieres_en-md.jpg 1024w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/Barrieres_en-lg.jpg 1366w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/Barrieres_en-xl.jpg 1600w, https://neyret.me/media/posts/5/responsive/Barrieres_en-2xl.jpg 1920w"><figcaption>Frequency of barriers reported by category of nature's contributions to people.
